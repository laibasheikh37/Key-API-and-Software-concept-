1. ## API:
 An Application Programming Interface enables software systems to communicate by exposing specific functionalities. It facilitates integration and data exchange between applications.
 
 2. ## SDK:
   A Software Development Kit provides tools, libraries, and documentation to simplify application development. It is tailored to specific platforms or environments.
   
3. ## Web APIs:
  Web APIs allow interaction with web-based services using HTTP protocols like REST or GraphQL. They enable data retrieval and integration across systems.
  
2. ## Library APIs:
  Library APIs offer predefined functions within programming libraries to streamline software development. They enhance efficiency by avoiding repetitive coding.
  
5. ## Prompting and Completion: 
 Prompting provides input to a Large Language Model (LLM), while completion is the model's generated response. Together, they drive contextual AI outputs.
